## üìå Overview 
This project involved configuring a Linux VM as a secure gateway for a Windows VM, implementing advanced network security controls using iptables and bind9. The goal was to understand key networking concepts such as routing, NAT, SSH, DNS, HTTPS, and firewalls while setting up security rules to control traffic and enhance protection.

### Architecture Overview
The project created a secure network architecture with the following components:
***Linux VM:***Configured as a gateway with two network interfaces:
- Adapter 1: NAT interface for internet access
- Adapter 2: Internal network interface for communication with the Windows VM

***Windows VM*** ‚Äì Connected to the Linux VM through an internal network, using the Linux VM as a gateway
### 0Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Setup
